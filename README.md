# FTC_FIREWORKS_2017-2018

This is the repository for the FTC team FIREWORKS. If you are a team member, hello! If you are an internet wanderer, we welcome you and hope you find our repo informational!

## Note:

Our robot uses the LinearOpMode template, so all the updated files (`HardwareTest`, `AutonomousTest`, and `TeleopTest`) are needed to run the full program. Classes dependent on the Vuforia platform--such as the autonomous classes, `VuMarkIdentificationTest`, and `TeleopJewelIDTest`--require the `VuforiaLocalizerImplSubclass` file to run in addition to the above.
